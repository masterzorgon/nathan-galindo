# Nathan Galindo's Website
This is a website by Nathan Galindo. It contains a collection of my long-form thoughts, projects, and technical skills.

## Customizing

I open-sourced this project so that anyone can clone the repository and re-brand it as their own. You can start editing this website by modifying the files in the `/src` folder. The site will auto-update as you edit these files.

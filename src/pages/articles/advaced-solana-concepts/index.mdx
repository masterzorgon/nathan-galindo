## Clockwork threads

[Clockwork threads](https://docs.clockwork.xyz/welcome/readme) are an automation primitive for developing Solana programs. Essentially,
we can use Clockwork threads to execute a series of instructions on our programs on a schedule
or in the event of some trigger.

You can trigger the execution of your smart contract using the following "triggers":

| **Trigger Condition** | **Description** | **Required Arguments** |
|---|---|---|
| Account | Starts execution when an account's data changes. | `address`: Account address to monitor. `offset`: Byte offset of account data to monitor. `size`: Size of byte slice to monitor (must be less than 1kb). |
| Cron | Starts execution based on a cron schedule. | `schedule`: Schedule in cron syntax. `skippable`: Boolean indicating if invocation can be skipped during Solana network unavailability. |
| Now | Starts execution immediately. | None |
| Slot | Starts execution when a specified slot passes. | `slot`: The slot to begin execution on. |
| Epoch | Starts execution when a specified epoch becomes active. | `epoch`: The epoch to begin execution on. |
| Timestamp | Starts execution when a specified Unix timestamp has passed. | `unix_ts`: The Unix timestamp to begin execution on. |
| Pyth | Starts execution when a price threshold is crossed. | `price_feed`: The Pyth price feed account to monitor. `equality`: Equality operator (≥ or ≤) to compare the price feed with the limit price. `limit`: Limit price that triggers execution. |

Creating automated cron jobs for the execution of your Solana programs opens up a world of
new use cases, such as:
* Recurring payments: Executes an SPL token transfer on a user-defined schedule
* Token distribution: Mints a new token and sends it to a target user every 60 seconds
* Subscriptions: Allows users to pay on a recurrent schedule

Below, I will walk you through what it looks like to create a Clockwork thread via cross program invocation (CPI) using the [Anchor framework](https://www.anchor-lang.com/):

```rust
  let bump = *ctx.bumps.get("thread_authority").unwrap();
  clockwork_sdk::cpi::thread_create(
      CpiContext::new_with_signer(
          clockwork_program.to_account_info(),
          clockwork_sdk::cpi::ThreadCreate {
              payer: payer.to_account_info(),
              system_program: system_program.to_account_info(),
              thread: thread.to_account_info(),
              authority: thread_authority.to_account_info(),
          },
          &[&[THREAD_AUTHORITY_SEED,payer.key().as_ref() , &[bump]]],
      ),
      LAMPORTS_PER_SOL / 10, // amount (0.1 sol)
      thread_id,              // id
      vec![target_ix.into()], // instructions
      trigger,                // trigger
  )?;
```
